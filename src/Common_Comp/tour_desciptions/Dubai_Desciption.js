          Apply For a Dubai Visit Visa
        </h2>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          Here is a general guide on how to apply for a Dubai visit visa from
          Pakistan:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 1: Identify Your Sponsor</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          To apply for a Dubai visa online, you typically need a sponsor, such
          as a resident, a company, or a hotel in Dubai. The sponsor will
          initiate the visa application process on your behalf. The sponsor has
          three different types, which include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Individual Sponsor:</span> If you have a
            family member or friend residing in Dubai, they can act as your
            sponsor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Company Sponsor:</span> If you are
            visiting Dubai for business purposes, your employer or a business in
            Dubai can sponsor your visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Hotel Sponsor:</span> Hotels can also
            act as sponsors for tourists. You may need to make a reservation
            with a hotel that offers this service.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 2: Gather Required Documents</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          Collect the necessary documents for the visa application. This may
          include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          <li>Passport copy (valid for at least six months)</li>
          <li>Passport-sized photos</li>
          <li>Completed visa application form</li>
          <li>Flight reservation details</li>
          <li>Accommodation reservation details</li>
          <li>Travel itinerary</li>
          <li>Proof of financial means (bank statements, pay stubs, etc.)</li>
          <li>
            Sponsorship letter and/or No Objection Certificate (if applicable)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          Step 3: Sponsor Initiates the Application
        </h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The sponsor will typically be responsible for initiating the visa
          application process. They may need to visit the relevant immigration
          or visa service center in Dubai.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 4: Application Submission</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The sponsor will submit your application and the required documents to
          the appropriate authorities. This can often be done online or in
          person.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 5: Visa Processing</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The visa processing time can vary, but you should receive updates on
          the status of your application. Once approved, the visa will be
          stamped on your passport.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 6: Travel to Dubai</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          With your approved Dubai Visit Visa, you can travel to Dubai on the
          specified dates. Make sure to adhere to the visa conditions, including
          the duration of stay and any other specific guidelines.
