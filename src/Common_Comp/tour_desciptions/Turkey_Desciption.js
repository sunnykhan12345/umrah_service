          Here is a general guide on how to apply for a Turkey visit visa from
          Pakistan:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 1: Identify Your Sponsor</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          To apply for a Turkey visa online, you typically need a sponsor, such
          as a resident, a company, or a hotel in Turkey. The sponsor will
          initiate the visa application process on your behalf. The sponsor has
          three different types, which include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Individual Sponsor:</span> If you have a
            family member or friend residing in Turkey, they can act as your
            sponsor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Company Sponsor:</span> If you are
            visiting Turkey for business purposes, your employer or a business
            in Turkey can sponsor your visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Hotel Sponsor:</span> Hotels can also
            act as sponsors for tourists. You may need to make a reservation
            with a hotel that offers this service.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 2: Gather Required Documents</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          Collect the necessary documents for the visa application. This may
          include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          <li>Passport copy (valid for at least six months)</li>
          <li>Passport-sized photos</li>
          <li>Completed visa application form</li>
          <li>Flight reservation details</li>
          <li>Accommodation reservation details</li>

          <li>
            Sponsorship letter and/or No Objection Certificate (if applicable)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
          Step 3: Sponsor Initiates the Application
        </h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The sponsor will typically be responsible for initiating the visa
          application process. They may need to visit the relevant immigration
          or visa service center in Turkey.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 4: Application Submission</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The sponsor will submit your application and the required documents to
          the appropriate authorities. This can often be done online or in
          person.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 5: Visa Processing</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
          The visa processing time can vary, but you should receive updates on
          the status of your application. Once approved, the visa will be
          stamped on your passport.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Step 6: Travel to Turkey</h3>
        <p className="lg:py-3 py-5 text-justify font-light">
